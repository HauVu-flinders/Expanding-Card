# Expanding-Card
This project is about expanding card:
 - there are 5 panels are built with different background images and a heading
 - Flexbox are used to align elements
 - I use JavaScript for event listener to change a panel to an active panel
 - with CSS transision, a picture will smoothly expand to larger size whenever a cursor point to it.
